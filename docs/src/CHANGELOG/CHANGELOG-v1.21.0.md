### Upgrading

https://github.com/LightBitsLabs/los-csi/tree/v1.21.0/docs/src/upgrade

### Highlights

- Fixed a discovery-client issue where the AuxSuffix was not appended during NVMe reconnection to the target for an auxiliary system

- Fixed a discovery-client issue where the kernel rejects the connections due to hostid mismatch by identifying existing NVMe controllers with the same hostnqn and and overriding the hostid to match these controllers. 

- Upgrading discovery-client from v3.14 or earlier to v3.15 or later while live NVMe connections exist may fail to connect additional NVMe controllers due to a kernel hostid mismatch. Existing controllers must be configured in the discovery-client via /etc/nvme/hostid or by specifying --hostid in the configuration file under /etc/discovery-client/discovery.d/.

- Fixed the issue with downloading Docker images from Lightbitsâ€™ public repository.

- Rename Docker images by appending 'UBI' to RHEL UBI-based container images.
